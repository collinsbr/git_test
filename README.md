# Readme for git test
This is a README for me to test git in command line.
I have a single file and it is a C program that prints "Hello, world."

Update 6/23:
I'm editing the README in the GitHub text editor.

Another update from GH text editor.

Update number 3 to test git pull.

Another update to the readme (done locally) to test pushing a local branch to remote.
